#Alignment QC

- Class: text
  Output: The standard output of alignment packages is a BAM file. Before downstream processing of aligned reads (.bam) in R, we must assess the quality of the alignments. In order to do this, we will use the qQCReport, from the QuasR package. First, install this package from bioconductor.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Install QuasR
  CorrectAnswer: BiocManager::install('QuasR')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'BiocManager::install("QuasR")')
  Hint: BiocManager::install()

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: After installation, make sure to load your package using the "library" function. 
  CorrectAnswer: library("QuasR")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'library("QuasR")')
  Hint: The format should be 'library(__"packageName"__)'

- Class: text
  Output: "In this course, we have excluded two example bam files for you to work with: 'treatment_bam' and 'input_bam'."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, run the qQCReport() function on your treatment bam file. This might take a moment. The quality report graphs will open up in a new window.
  CorrectAnswer: qQCReport(treatment_bam)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'qQCReport(treatment_bam)')
  Hint: Use ?QuasR::qRCReport to see the help documentation!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Next, run it again on your input control bam file. This might also take a moment.
  CorrectAnswer: qQCReport(input_bam)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'qQCReport(input_bam)')
  Hint: Use ?QuasR::qRCReport to see the help documentation!
