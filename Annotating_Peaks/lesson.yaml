#Annotate Peaks

- Class: text
  Output: "We're now going to determine what type of regulatory elements your ChIP is binding to. In order to do this, we will be using the 'annotatePeak' function from the ChIPseeker package. By now I'm sure you're an expert in how to get this set up, but let me walk you through it one last time anyway."


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Install ChIPseeker
  CorrectAnswer: BiocManager::install('ChIPseeker')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'BiocManager::install("ChIPseeker")')
  Hint: Use BiocManager::install() to get the job done!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: After installation, make sure to load your package using the "library" function. 
  CorrectAnswer: library("ChIPseeker")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'library("ChIPseeker")')
  Hint: The format should be "library(__"packageName"__)

- Class: text
  Output: The peaks file from the "peak calling" lesson is already loaded into your environment in a variable named "peaks".


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: And now annotate your peak variable using the annotatePeak function. Save this to a variable named annot. This might take a moment and produce a couple of warning messages.
  CorrectAnswer: annot <- annotatePeak(peaks)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'annot <- annotatePeak(peaks)')
  Hint: Use ChIPseeker::annotatePeak to see the help documentation!


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: And to conclude today's lesson, let's generate a plotted result. We'll make a pie chart of the regulatory regions your peaks are found in, using the plotAnnoPie function. All you have to do is run that function on your annot variable!
  CorrectAnswer: plotAnnoPie(annot)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'plotAnnoPie(annot)')
  Hint: Use ?ChIPseeker::plotAnnoPie to see the help documentation!

- Class: text
  Output: "And that's all for this lesson! You've learned a lot by now and should feel a sense of accomplishment. In future lessons, we'll discuss how to functionally annotate your regions using gene ontology, and how to compare them to other treatment conditions. Thanks for completing this lesson!"
